# E bazaar frontend
## small E-commerce project to Add new products, Search products, Add/Edit quantity/Delete products from cart.

## Live app link - https://e-bazaar-by-arshad.netlify.app/

## Might have to try a few times to access the live link as the backend is hosted on render and render servers shut down due to inactivity.

## Getting started locally - 

First you'll need to clone this project and then run the development server by running

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

In terminal and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
